Welcome to the BBOB workshop series!
================================================


The Black-box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) workshop series provides an easy-to-use toolchain for
benchmarking black-box optimization algorithms for continuous domains and a place to present, compare, and discuss
the performance of numerical black-box optimization algorithms. The former is realized through the Comparing Continuous
Optimizers platform (Coco).

So far, six workshops have been held (in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015 at GECCO and 2015 at CEC). The next workshop
is planned for GECCO 2016 with a new focus on bi-objective problems.

Generally, three benchmark suites are available:

* bbob: 24 noiseless functions
* bbob-noisy: 30 noisy functions
* bbob-biobj: 55 noiseless, bi-objective functions, generated from instances of the bbob suite
