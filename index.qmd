# Welcome to the BBOB workshop series!

The Black-box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) workshop series provides
an easy-to-use toolchain for benchmarking black-box optimization
algorithms for continuous and mixed-integer domains and a place to
present, compare, and discuss the performance of numerical black-box
optimization algorithms. The former is realized through the Comparing
Continuous Optimizers platform (Coco).

So far, twelve workshops have been held (in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013,
2015, [2016](bbob2016.html), [2017](bbob2017.html),
[2018](bbob2018.html), [2019](bbob2019.html),
[2021](bbob2021.html), [2022](bbob2022.html), and in
[2023](bbob2023.html) at GECCO and in 2015 at CEC). The next workshop
is going to take place during GECCO [2025](bbob2025.html).


Generally, seven benchmark suites are available:

-   `bbob` containing 24 noiseless functions
-   `bbob-noisy` containing 30 noisy functions
-   `bbob-biobj` containing 55 noiseless, bi-objective functions,
    generated from the `bbob` suite
-   `bbob-largescale` containing 24 noiseless functions in dimension 20
    to 640
-   `bbob-mixint` containing 24 noiseless mixed-integer functions
-   `bbob-biobj-mixint` containing 92 noiseless, bi-objective,
    mixed-integer functions
-   `bbob-constrained` containing 10 noiseless functions with varying
    number of constraints.


## Continuous Submission of Benchmarking Data

Since 2020, we also welcome submissions of data from benchmarking
experiments on the above test suites throughout the year. Please open a
submission issue at <https://github.com/numbbo/coco/issues/new/choose> .
