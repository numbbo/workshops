# BBOB workshops before 2016

The Black-Box-Optimization-Benchmarking (BBOB) workshop series goes back
to the first edition at GECCO 2009 and has been taking place
subsequently during the GECCO conference in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015 and
later years. There has been also a special session on the same topic at
the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC\'2015) in Sendai,
Japan.
